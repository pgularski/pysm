'''Python State Machine

The goal of this library is to give you a close to the State Pattern
simplicity with much more flexibility. And, if needed, the full state machine
functionality, including `FSM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`_, `HSM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine
#Hierarchically_nested_states>`_, `PDA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton>`_ and other tasty things.

Goals:
    - Provide a State Pattern-like behavior with more flexibility
    - Be explicit and don't add any code to objects
    - Handle directly any kind of event (not only strings) - parsing strings is
      cool again!
    - Keep it simple, even for someone who's not very familiar with the FSM
      terminology

class Event(object):

    Events are also used to control the flow of data propagated to states
    within the states hierarchy.

    Event objects have the following attributes set after an event has been
    dispatched:

    **Attributes:**

        .. attribute:: state_machine

            A |StateMachine| instance that is handling the event (the one whose
            :func:`pysm.pysm.StateMachine.dispatch` method is called)

        .. attribute:: propagate

            An event is propagated from a current leaf state up in the states
            hierarchy until it encounters a handler that can handle the event.
            To propagate it further, it has to be set to `True` in a handler.

    :param name: Name of an event. It may be anything as long as it's hashable.
    :type name: |Hashable|
    :param input: Optional input. Anything hashable.
    :type input: |Hashable|
    :param \*\*cargo: Keyword arguments for an event, used to transport data to
        handlers.  It's added to an event as a `cargo` property of type `dict`.
        For `enter` and `exit` events, the original event that triggered a
        transition is passed in cargo as `source_event` entry.

    .. note`:

        `enter` and `exit` events are never propagated, even if the `propagate`
        flag is set to `True` in a handler.

    **Example Usage:**

    .. code-block:: python

        state_machine.dispatch(Event('start'))
        state_machine.dispatch(Event('start', key='value'))
        state_machine.dispatch(Event('parse', input='#', entity=my_object))

        Event handlers are kept in a `dict`, with events' names as keys,
        therefore registered events may be of any hashable type.

        Handlers take two arguments:

        - **state**: The current state that is handling an event. The same
              handler function may be attached to many states, therefore it
              is helpful to get the handling state's instance.
        - **event**: An event that triggered the handler call. If it is an
              `enter` or `exit` event, then the source event (the one that
              triggered the transition) is passed in `event`'s cargo
              property as `cargo.source_event`.

class StateMachine(State):
    '''State machine controls actions and transitions.

    To provide the State Pattern-like behavior, the formal state machine rules
    may be slightly broken, and instead of creating an `internal transition
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine #Internal_transitions>`_
    for every action that doesn't require a state change, event handlers may be
    added to states. These are handled first when an event occurs. After that
    the actual transition is called, calling `enter`/`exit` actions and other
    transition actions. Nevertheless, internal transitions are also supported.

    So the order of calls on an event is as follows:

        1. State's event handler
        2. `condition` callback
        3. `before` callback
        4. `exit` handlers
        5. `action` callback
        6. `enter` handlers
        7. `after` callback

    If there's no handler in states or transition for an event, it is silently
    ignored.

    If using nested state machines, all events should be sent to the root state
    machine.

    **Attributes:**

        .. attribute:: state

            Current, local state (instance of |State|) in a state machine.

        .. attribute:: stack

            Stack that can be used if the `Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
            <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton>`_ functionality
            is needed.

        .. attribute:: state_stack

            Stack of previous local states in a state machine. With every
            transition, a previous state (instance of |State|) is pushed to the
            `state_stack`. Only :attr:`.StateMachine.STACK_SIZE` (32
            by default) are stored and old values are removed from the stack.

        .. attribute:: leaf_state_stack

            Stack of previous leaf states in a state machine. With every
            transition, a previous leaf state (instance of |State|) is pushed
            to the `leaf_state_stack`. Only
            :attr:`.StateMachine.STACK_SIZE` (32 by default) are
            stored and old values are removed from the stack.

        **leaf_state**
            See the :attr:`~.StateMachine.leaf_state` property.

        **root_machine**
            See the :attr:`~.StateMachine.root_machine` property.

    :param name: Human readable state machine name
    :type name: str

    .. note ::

        |StateMachine| extends |State| and therefore it is possible to always
        use a |StateMachine| instance instead of the |State|. This wouldn't
        be a good practice though, as the |State| class is designed to be as
        small as possible memory-wise and thus it's more memory efficient. It
        is valid to replace a |State| with a |StateMachine| later on if there's
        a need to extend a state with internal states.

    .. note::

        For the sake of speed thread safety isn't guaranteed.

    **Example Usage:**

    .. code-block:: python

        state_machine = StateMachine('root_machine')
