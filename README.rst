Implement simple and complex state machines
------------------------------------------

It can do simple things like this:

Or somewhat more complex like that:

Python State Machine
--------------------

`The State Pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern>`_
solves many problems, untangles the code and saves one's sanity.
Yet.., it's a bit rigid and doesn't scale. The goal of this library is to give
you a close to the State Pattern simplicity with much more flexibility. And,
if needed, the full state machine functionality, including `FSM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`_, `HSM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine
#Hierarchically_nested_states>`_, `PDA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton>`_ and other tasty things.


Goals
-----

* Provide a State Pattern-like behavior with more flexibility (see
  `Documentation <http://pysm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_ for
  examples)
* Be explicit and don't add any magic code to objects that use pysm
* Handle directly any kind of event or input (not only strings) - parsing
  strings is cool again!
* Keep it simple, even for someone who's not very familiar with the FSM
  terminology


Features
--------

* Finite State Machine (FSM)
* Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) with Internal/External/Local transitions
* Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
* Transition callbacks - action, before, after
* State hooks - enter, exit, and other event handlers
* Entry and exit actions are associated with states, not transitions
* Events may be anything as long as they're hashable
* States history and transition to previous states
* Conditional transitions (if/elif/else-like logic)
* Explicit behaviour (no method or attribute is added to the object containing a state machine)
* No need to extend a class with State Machine class (composition over inheritance)
* Fast (even with hundreds of transition rules)
* Not too many pythonisms, so that it's easily portable to other languages (ie. `JavaScript <https://github.com/pgularski/smjs>`_).
* Micropython support


Installation
------------

Install pysm from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysm/>`_::

    pip install pysm

or clone the `Github pysm repository <https://github.com/pgularski/pysm/>`_::

    git clone https://github.com/pgularski/pysm
    cd pysm
    python setup.py install


Documentation
-------------

Read the docs for API documentation and examples - http://pysm.readthedocs.io/

See Unit Tests to see it working and extensively tested.

Micropython support
-------------------
The library works with pyboards!::

   import upip
   upip.install('upysm')
